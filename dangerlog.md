# HTTP Caching Proxy - Danger Log

## Design Challenges

### Multi-threaded Concurrency
- **Problem**: Designing a thread-safe system to handle multiple concurrent connections while sharing a cache.
- **Solution**: Implemented a thread-per-connection model with mutex locks for cache access. Used `std::lock_guard` to ensure proper synchronization.
- **Lesson**: Careful consideration of shared resource access patterns is critical in multi-threaded applications. We spent days debugging weird intermittent issues before realizing we needed finer-grained locks!

### HTTP Protocol Parsing
- **Problem**: HTTP protocol has complex specifications with various edge cases.
- **Solution**: Leveraged `Boost.Beast` for robust HTTP parsing, which simplified handling of headers, chunked encoding, and other HTTP complexities.
- **Lesson**: Using established libraries for protocol parsing is more reliable than implementing from scratch. We initially tried to write our own parser and quickly regretted it when faced with all the edge cases.

## Implementation Challenges

### Cache Validation Mechanism
- **Problem**: Implementing proper cache validation with ETag and Last-Modified headers.
- **Solution**: Created a validation system that checks cache status and sends conditional requests (`If-None-Match`, `If-Modified-Since`) when needed.
- **Lesson**: HTTP caching is more complex than simple storage; it requires careful implementation of validation mechanisms.

### CONNECT Method Handling
- **Problem**: CONNECT method requires creating a transparent tunnel between client and server, unlike other HTTP methods.
- **Solution**: Implemented a bidirectional data forwarding mechanism using `select()` for I/O multiplexing.
- **Lesson**: Different HTTP methods may require fundamentally different handling approaches. CONNECT was particularly tricky because it's essentially creating a raw TCP tunnel rather than processing HTTP.

### Chunked Transfer Encoding
- **Problem**: Handling responses with chunked transfer encoding requires special processing.
- **Solution**: Implemented chunk-by-chunk reading and proper reassembly of the complete response.
- **Lesson**: HTTP has various transfer mechanisms that require specific handling logic. We spent hours debugging why some responses were getting cut off before realizing we weren't handling the chunked encoding correctly.

## Debugging Challenges

### Race Conditions in Cache Access
- **Problem**: Intermittent failures due to race conditions when multiple threads accessed the cache.
- **Solution**: Added more granular locking and improved the thread safety of the Cache class.
- **Lesson**: Race conditions can be difficult to reproduce and diagnose; thorough testing under load is essential. We literally had to add print statements everywhere and run the proxy lots of times to catch these issues.

### Network Error Handling
- **Problem**: Various network errors (timeouts, connection resets) caused the proxy to crash.
- **Solution**: Implemented comprehensive error handling with try-catch blocks and proper socket cleanup.
- **Lesson**: Network programming requires robust error handling for all possible failure scenarios.

### Docker Environment Issues
- **Problem**: Running the proxy as a daemon in Docker caused container termination.
- **Solution**: Modified the daemon implementation to work correctly in a containerized environment.
- **Lesson**: Container environments have different process management requirements than traditional systems.

## Testing Challenges

### Testing Cache Revalidation
- **Problem**: Verifying that max-age=0 correctly triggers revalidation was difficult.
- **Solution**: Created a specific test case that checks for different Date headers in responses.
- **Lesson**: Testing cache behavior requires careful examination of response headers rather than just content.

### Handling Website Changes
- **Problem**: Test URLs returning unexpected responses
- **Solution**: Updated tests to handle the actual behavior of target websites.
- **Lesson**: External dependencies in tests can break as websites change; tests should be adaptable.

### Concurrent Request Testing
- **Problem**: Testing the proxy's ability to handle multiple simultaneous connections was challenging.
- **Solution**: Developed a multi-threaded test that sends numerous requests concurrently and verifies all responses.
- **Lesson**: Stress testing revealed bottlenecks in our implementation that weren't apparent with sequential tests.

## Error Handling Improvements

### Malformed Request Handling
- **Problem**: The proxy initially crashed when receiving severely malformed HTTP requests.
- **Solution**: Enhanced request parsing with better error detection and graceful responses for invalid requests.
- **Lesson**: Users (and attackers) can send anything over the wire - never assume requests will be well-formed.

### Timeout Management
- **Problem**: Connections to slow servers would hang indefinitely, tying up threads.
- **Solution**: Implemented configurable timeouts for all network operations.
- **Lesson**: Always set timeouts for network operations! This seems obvious in retrospect, but it wasn't until our proxy hung during testing that we realized how important this is.

## Conclusion

Developing this HTTP caching proxy has been quite the journey! What started as a seemingly straightforward project quickly revealed layers of complexity we hadn't anticipated. The most challenging aspects were definitely ensuring thread safety in the cache implementation and correctly handling the various HTTP caching directives according to the specs.

This project gave us a much deeper appreciation for the complexity of network protocols and concurrent programming. It's one thing to read about these concepts in a textbook, but implementing them from scratch really drives the lessons home. We've gained valuable skills in debugging multi-threaded applications and a much better understanding of HTTP's intricacies.

If we were to do this project again, we'd start with a more thorough design phase focused on thread safety and error handling from the beginning, rather than adding these considerations later. We'd also build a more comprehensive test suite earlier in the development process.

Overall, despite the challenges (or perhaps because of them), this has been one of the most educational projects we've worked on in our programming journey.
