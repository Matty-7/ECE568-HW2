# HTTP Caching Proxy - Danger Log

## Design Challenges

### Multi-threaded Concurrency
- **Problem**: Designing a thread-safe system to handle multiple concurrent connections while sharing a cache.
- **Solution**: Implemented a thread-per-connection model with mutex locks for cache access. Used `std::lock_guard` to ensure proper synchronization.
- **Lesson**: Careful consideration of shared resource access patterns is critical in multi-threaded applications.

### HTTP Protocol Parsing
- **Problem**: HTTP protocol has complex specifications with various edge cases.
- **Solution**: Leveraged Boost.Beast for robust HTTP parsing, which simplified handling of headers, chunked encoding, and other HTTP complexities.
- **Lesson**: Using established libraries for protocol parsing is more reliable than implementing from scratch.

## Implementation Challenges

### Cache Validation Mechanism
- **Problem**: Implementing proper cache validation with ETag and Last-Modified headers.
- **Solution**: Created a validation system that checks cache status and sends conditional requests (If-None-Match, If-Modified-Since) when needed.
- **Lesson**: HTTP caching is more complex than simple storage; it requires careful implementation of validation mechanisms.

### CONNECT Method Handling
- **Problem**: CONNECT method requires creating a transparent tunnel between client and server, unlike other HTTP methods.
- **Solution**: Implemented a bidirectional data forwarding mechanism using `select()` for I/O multiplexing.
- **Lesson**: Different HTTP methods may require fundamentally different handling approaches.

### Chunked Transfer Encoding
- **Problem**: Handling responses with chunked transfer encoding requires special processing.
- **Solution**: Implemented chunk-by-chunk reading and proper reassembly of the complete response.
- **Lesson**: HTTP has various transfer mechanisms that require specific handling logic.

## Debugging Challenges

### Race Conditions in Cache Access
- **Problem**: Intermittent failures due to race conditions when multiple threads accessed the cache.
- **Solution**: Added more granular locking and improved the thread safety of the Cache class.
- **Lesson**: Race conditions can be difficult to reproduce and diagnose; thorough testing under load is essential.

### Network Error Handling
- **Problem**: Various network errors (timeouts, connection resets) caused the proxy to crash.
- **Solution**: Implemented comprehensive error handling with try-catch blocks and proper socket cleanup.
- **Lesson**: Network programming requires robust error handling for all possible failure scenarios.

### Docker Environment Issues
- **Problem**: Running the proxy as a daemon in Docker caused container termination.
- **Solution**: Modified the daemon implementation to work correctly in a containerized environment.
- **Lesson**: Container environments have different process management requirements than traditional systems.

## Testing Challenges

### Testing Cache Revalidation
- **Problem**: Verifying that max-age=0 correctly triggers revalidation was difficult.
- **Solution**: Created a specific test case that checks for different Date headers in responses.
- **Lesson**: Testing cache behavior requires careful examination of response headers rather than just content.

### Handling Website Changes
- **Problem**: Test URLs returning unexpected responses (e.g., 301 redirects instead of 200 OK).
- **Solution**: Updated tests to handle the actual behavior of target websites.
- **Lesson**: External dependencies in tests can break as websites change; tests should be adaptable.

## Conclusion

Developing this HTTP caching proxy provided valuable insights into network programming, protocol implementation, and concurrent system design. The most significant challenges were ensuring thread safety in the cache implementation and correctly handling the various HTTP caching directives. These challenges required careful reading of the HTTP specifications and thoughtful design decisions.

The project demonstrated the importance of robust error handling in networked applications and the value of thorough testing under various conditions. It also highlighted how seemingly simple requirements (like caching) can involve complex implementation details when following protocol specifications correctly.
